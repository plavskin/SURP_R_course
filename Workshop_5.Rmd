# Review

```{r}
review_vector <- c(1, 2.6, NA, 4.98, 1.5, NA)

# run a function that will determine which of the values in review_vector is a
# missing value

# run an operation that will determine which of the numbers in review_vector is
# greater than 2 and less than 4

# use the logical vector above to create a subvector of review_vector that only
# includes the elements of review_vector that are greater than 2 and less than 4



leaf_number <- c(5, 8, 5, 11, 4, 5, 8, 13, 10, 4, 7)

# make a logical vector called many_leaves that tells you whether each position
# in leaf_number is greater than 10

# use many_leaves to set each value of leaf_number over 10 to infinity (Inf)

```

# Logicals

## Introduction to logicals

In R, in addition to character and numeric values, we can have logical values. Logical values are `TRUE` and `FALSE`. These words, when you type them, are something like `NA` in that they're special words. 

Logical values are often generated by comparisons between two values. These comparisons are made with logical operators. Many of them you will be familiar with.
```{r Logic}
3 > 4
8 < 5
4 <= 4
```

Note that the logical operator "is equal to" is `==` in R. If you only use `=`, you will reassign your variable (that is `=` in R is the same as `<-`).  
"Not" is specified by `!`. So "is not equal to" is `!=`.

Try to figure out what the output of each of the following lines will be before running them.
```{r}
TRUE == TRUE

TRUE == FALSE

TRUE != FALSE

3 != 4

char = 'a'
char == 'a'

char = 'b'
char == 'a'
```

## Looking for missing values in a vector

One useful function that results in a logical value is `is.na()`
```{r}
# try using is.na() on position 11 in review_vec

# try using is.na() on review_vec

# try using is.na() on data_vector

```

Just like you can make a vector of characters or a vector of numeric values, you can also make a vector of logicals.
```{r}
# Make a vector with 3 TRUEs and 2 FALSEs, save it as logical_vec1

# Make a vector called num_vec that starts at 2 and ends at 10 (increasing by 1)

logical_vec2 <- num_vec %% 3 == 2 #what is this line of code doing?
```

## Treating numbers as logicals

In R, FALSE is also encoded as 0, and TRUE is encoded as 1. 
```{r}
0==FALSE
1==TRUE

# How do you think we could easily figure out how many TRUEs there are in logical_vec2?

# How can you get R to tell you the number of missing values in data_vector?

```

Numbers can be treated like logical values, especially with `as.logical()`. 0 is false, everything else is true.
```{r}
as.logical(-2:2)

sum(as.logical(-2:2)) # what is going on here?
```

## Exercise

Imagine that you're doing an experiment measuring plant height, but some of the plants didn't grow. You decide those should be considered missing values, so they entered `NA` for those plants. Let's count the number of plants that DID grow in your experiment.

```{r}
plant_heights <- c(1.9, 0.1, NA, 0.8, 0.4, 0.2, 7.9, NA, 16.8, 3.5)

# create a logical vector, plant_NA_vector, that contains information on whether
# each value in plant_heights is missing (NA)

# use plant_NA_vector to figure out how many plants total didn't grow
# assign this number to a variable and print it out

# use plant_NA_vector to figure out how many plants DID grow
# assign this number to a variable and print it out

# bonus:figure out what PROPORTION of plants grew
# assign this number to a variable and print it out

```

# Selecting and replacing values from vectors based on logicals

In addition to using indices to get R to tell us a specific position in a vector, we can also use them to replace specific values. Take a look at this example.
```{r}
vector_to_sub <- c(12, 13, 14, 15, NA, 17, 18, 19)

# replace the 2nd value in vector_to_sub with 54
vector_to_sub[2] <- 54
print(vector_to_sub)

# now, try replacing the 1st, 3rd, and 8th values in vector_to_sub with 28,
# using only one line of code (i.e. do it all at once)

```

One really powerful way to use this vector substitution is to combine it with logical vectors. Take a look at the example below:
```{r}
vector_to_sub2 <- 1:3
vector_to_sub2[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)] <- 42

# What do you think vector_to_sub2 looks like now? Print it out to check

```

Try this for yourself. Lots of times, we want to replace missing values in vectors. Let's say that, when you do your analysis on the plant example above, you want to treat the plants that didn't grow as having a height of 0 rather than being missing.
```{r}
# use plant_NA_vector to replace every missing value in plant_heights with a 0

# print the modified plant_heights vector

```

# Operations on logicals (AND, OR)

We can also do "and" (`&`) and "or" (`|`, all the way on the right side of your keyboard). "And" only returns true if both things are true. "Or" returns true if at least one thing is true.

Try predicting what all the operations below will return
```{r}
TRUE & TRUE
TRUE & FALSE
FALSE & FALSE

FALSE | TRUE
TRUE | TRUE
FALSE | FALSE

# bonus: perform some operations on the following variables (unicorns and
# rainbows) that will result in a TRUE value being returned
unicorns <- FALSE
rainbows <- FALSE

```

# Data Frames: Reading in and manipulating data, writing data

So far, everything we've been doing in R has involved vectors. However, we haven't yet learned about the most useful data structure in R: data frames.

Data frames are essentially just tables. They have rows and columns, and if you set your data up right, they make it *incredibly* easy to explore your data. R has a ton of operations that are specialized in reading data frames and either plotting them in an easy way, or summarizing the data inside, and we're going to be spending the next couple of days learning about those.

```{r}
if (dir.exists('class_figures')){
  library(knitr)
  include_graphics('class_figures/df_illustration.png')
}
```

## Reading in tables from excel

A lot of times, it's not really convenient to enter your data in R. When collecting data by hand, it can be really convenient to type it into excel (or google sheets). Although there is a special package in R that can read excel format files (**.xlsx**), this is not commonly used. Instead, we usually save files in **.csv** format, which throws out all of the special formatting excel does and just keeps the data itself.

**csv** stands for *comma-separated values*, and that's just what they are. These files can be easily opened in excel or google sheets, but if you open them in notepad, you can see that they're really just rows of numbers and words separated by... you guessed it, commas.

You should have a dataset in csv format called *iris.csv*. This is a set of information on flower structure collected from plants of 3 iris species. Follow along with this file as we go through the rules. The code below will only work if you have iris.csv saved in the same folder as this file.

First, let's get R to read in the iris data. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/plavskin/Intro_R_Course/blob/master/iris.csv); right-click (or, on a Mac, control-click) the 'Raw" button on the upper right, select "save link as...", and download it into the same folder as this workshop file.
```{r}
# this is actually a built-in dataset in R, but I saved it as a csv so we can
# practice importing
iris_df <- read.csv('iris.csv')
View(iris_df)
```

There are some good practices for how to organize and record your data, and following these will make your life *MUCH* easier when you try to analyze your data. Following these rules means that R will be able to easily read you data, and that the data is immediately set up in such a way that the built-in R functions for processing data can easily work with it.

* Give each column a short, informative title. Avoid spaces and weird symbols/punctuation. You can use letters, numbers, periods, underscores ( _ ) and hyphens. *NEVER* use commas in your data entry.

* You can also name rows, but I suggest avoiding this for now, since you will need to provide a special argument to `read.csv` if you do this.

* Keep a single column as one data type (e.g. a column can contain strings, or numbers, or logicals). R will usually know which is which, and treat the data accordingly.

* Notice that in the iris dataframe, every row holds a single observation. That is, data on each single data point (plant) is one row, and each individual piece of information about it is one column (e.g. how wide were its petals? What species did this plant belong to?)

The last point on this list involves thinking about what constitutes an 'observation' in your data. This can seem subjective! Let's say you're tracking plant growth over time: is a single observation one plant, or one timepoint? As you program, you'll start getting an intuitive feeling for better and worse ways to organize data. But remember that data can always be re-organized in R if you don't like how you originally did it (or if someone else collected the data!) These principles of data organization are called *tidy* data, and there is *hugely* useful package, **tidyr** that contains functions to re-organize and tidy up your data. We won't cover it in this class, but I want to share a [link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) with some info in case you continue programming in the future and find that you need it.

## Selecting data from data frames: row numbers and column numbers and $

Let's say we wanted to calculate the mean petal width of all the irises measured in the iris dataset. How can we do this? We need to select the petal width column. There are a couple of ways to do this. The easiest and most common one is using `$`.

```{r}
# print out all the sepal lengths
print(iris_df$Sepal.Length)

# get the mean of the petal widths

```

We can also use indexing to get a specific row and column position in the data frame. Remember that when we used indexing for vectors, we put the necessary position (or vector of positions) in square brackets after the name of the vector. In a data frame, we need to specify both the row position(s), and the column position(s).

When using indices to specify position in a data frame, **rows first, columns second**

```{r}
# Get the value in the second row and third column in the iris dataset
print(iris_df[2, 3])

# Get the values in the 2nd to 5th rows in the fifth column in iris_df

```

In addition to using numeric indices, you can also use names of columns (or rows, if they're named!)
```{r}
print(iris_df[2, 'Petal.Length'])
```

Finally, if you want to get *every* row or *every* column, just leave that index blank.
```{r}
# get every element from 2nd column (same as iris_df$Sepal.Width)
print(iris_df[ , 2])

# get every value in the 6th row of iris_df

```

## Creating new columns from operations on other columns

A lot of times, we need to process the data we have in order for it to be interesting to us. You can imagine a scenario in which we'd want to do this in the iris dataset. We have a list of measures petal widths and lengths from various species, and maybe we want to eventually investigate how these vary across species. But the problem is that even within a species, some flowers just happen to be larger, by chance. These would have BOTH higher petal lengths and widths, making our dataset noisier. Maybe what we really care about is the ratio of petal length to width? R makes calculating this easy.

```{r}
# remember that to specify a column, we can use $. We can also use this to
# create a new column, Petal.Ratio
iris_df$Petal.Ratio <- iris_df$Petal.Length / iris_df$Petal.Width

```

## Creating new data frames from scratch and writing them

Sometimes, you will want to create a brand new data frame from scratch. There are several ways to do this. One way is to create vectors for each column, and then combine them together in a data frame. For example, let's imagine we have investigated the populations of squirrels and pigeons in 4 parks in NYC.

We can make 3 vectors, one with the names of the parks, one with the population of squirrels, and one with the population of pigeons. 
```{r}
park <- c("WashingtonSq", "CentralPark", "ProspectPark", "BatteryPark")
pigeons <- c(8.62e3, 1.5e4, 1939, 276)
rats <- c(1500, 41320, 20003, 4057)
squirrels<- c("358", "546", "439", "344")
```
Then, we can use the function `data.frame()` to turn these into a single data frame. The positions in the vectors will correspond to rows, and the names of the vectors will become the column names.
```{r}
parks_df <- data.frame(park, squirrels, rats, pigeons)
parks_df

# another common way to do the same thing
parks_df_2 <-
  data.frame(
    park = c("WashingtonSq", "CentralPark", "ProspectPark", "BatteryPark"),
    squirrels = c("358", "546", "439", "344"),
    rats = c(1500, 41320, 20003, 4057),
    pigeons = c(8.62e3, 1.5e4, 1939, 276)
    )
parks_df_2
```

```{r}
#try accessing the values rows 1, 2, and 3 of column 1
```

What if you wanted to share this data with a colleague, so they could do their own calculations? The nicest way would be to send them a csv. We can make csvs from data frames in R using `write.csv()`. Take a look at the documentation for this function.

```{r}
# write a csv called 'parks.csv' with the data in parks_df
```

## Watch out for factors!
You may have noticed that accessing the park column gave us something that involved "levels". These are because they're actually not characters, but something called factors. Factors are categorical variables. These are very important for some types of statistical models, but they can be a problem if you are expecting characters or numbers.

Let's look at the `data.frame` again.
```{r}
View(parks_df)
```

Let's try to access the population of squirrels as a number.

```{r}
parks_df$squirrels
as.numeric(parks_df$squirrels)
```

As you can see, the character numbers are being converted not to the numbers they should be, but to their factor levels. I'm sure you can imagine how this could be a huge problem.

When something is a factor and your want it to be a number, do this:

```{r}
as.numeric(as.character(parks_df$squirrels)) 
```

By first going through `as.character` and THEN `as.numeric`, you
preserve your entries as intended.

Finally, if you want to change the values in the data frame, you must remember to reassign that column

```{r}
as.numeric(as.character(parks_df$squirrels)) 
str(parks_df)
parks_df[,3] <- as.numeric(as.character(parks_df$squirrels)) 
str(parks_df)
```

## Calculate column means, standard deviations, standard errors

Now, maybe we want to use these columns to find out something about parks in NYC. Maybe we want to find the average number of rats and pigeons in NYC parks.

```{r}
# find the mean number of rats and pigeons for parks in NYC
```

We also want to know the amount of variation in pigeon and rat populations.

```{r}
# calculate the standard deviation - use google to help you find functions
```

If we have many columns with numeric data, finding the mean of each of them individually could take a while. We can use the function `colMeans()` instead. Take a look at the documentation for `colMeans()`

```{r}
# try using colMeans() to find the mean number of rats and pigeons for parks in NYC

# do you run into problems? why? how could we get what we want using this function?
```
